# eventops-server
## Full Stack Web Development Specialization Capstone Project - Server, REST API &amp; browser client
### Running
Before start the server, you need to start the mongodb service
```
npm install
node server
```
The server is bounded to the port 3000 by default. Bundled with the server is the browser version, you can access with any browser typing the URL http://localhost:3000

Anyway, an instance of the server is running in the [IBM Cloud](https://eventops.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/#!/)
